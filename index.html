        <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Eli,</h1>
        <p>From London, now based in Tel Aviv, with extensive frontend knowledge and growing backend expertise. I've
            worked
            at a websit development agency, for a prop-tech startup, freelance under my own brand and completed
            countless
            projects from websites for real estate firms, care homes, and even a mental health organization. I'm here to
            help you create sleek, functional, and user-friendly websites that tell your story effectively.</p>
